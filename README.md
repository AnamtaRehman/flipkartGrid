### ðŸ˜ƒ Steps to Run and Test the Web Application:

1. Open the **`main.ipynb`** file in Google Colab.  
2. Ensure you are connected to a high-performance GPU, preferably **A100 or higher**.  
3. Create a folder named **`templates`** in the Colab environment. Upload the required **`details.html`** and **`freshness.html`** files into this folder.  
4. Execute all the cells in the notebook sequentially.  
5. Upon successful execution, a **unique live link** to the web application will be generated. Click on the link to **access and test the application**.  

   *(Sample preview of the link: A unique link will be generated during runtime, which you can open on any device.)*
