This solution has been developed using three distinct approaches, each introducing unique advancements and features:

Solution_v1: The foundational implementation that sets the groundwork for extracting product details and freshness.

Solution_v2: A refined version with enhanced accuracy, efficiency, and improved handling of diverse packaging.

Solution_v3: The latest and most advanced iteration, incorporating state-of-the-art methods for optimal performance and scalability.
You can explore and test each version individually by following the instructions provided below.


### ðŸ˜ƒ Steps to Run and Test the Web Application:

1. Open the **`Solution_vx`** file in Google Colab.  
2. Ensure you are connected to a high-performance GPU, preferably **A100 or higher**. (preferred for Solution_v1 and Solution_v2), : **Solution_v3 can even run on cpu!**
4. Create a folder named **`templates`** in the Colab environment. Upload the required **`details.html`** and **`freshness.html`** files into this folder.  
5. Execute all the cells in the notebook sequentially.  
6. Upon successful execution, a **unique live link** to the web application will be generated. Click on the link to **access and test the application**.  

   *(Sample preview of the link: A unique link will be generated during runtime, which you can open on any device.)*
